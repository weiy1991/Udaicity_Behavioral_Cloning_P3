# Behaviorial Cloning Project

[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
This repository contains starting files for the Behavioral Cloning Project in Udacity.

In this project, I used deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. I have trained, validated and tested a model using Keras. The model will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

I used the simulator that Udacity provided where I can steer a car around a track for data collection. I used image data and steering angles to train a neural network and then use this model to drive the car autonomously around the track by the simulator.

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Dependencies
This  requires:

* cv2
* tensorflow
* keras
* python3.6

Here I use python3.6 with anaconda3. You can configure your own python environment as you want.

The following resources can be found in this github repository:
* drive.py
* video.py
* clone.py
* model.h5
* video.mp4


The simulator can be downloaded from [simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim)


## Details About Files In This Directory

### `drive.py`

Usage of `drive.py` requires you have saved the trained model as an h5 file, i.e. `model.h5`. See the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model) for how to create this file using the following command:
```sh
model.save(filepath)
```

Once the model has been saved, it can be used with drive.py using this command:

```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

The above command will load the trained model and use the model to make predictions on individual images in real-time and send the predicted angle back to the server via a websocket connection.

Note: There is known local system's setting issue with replacing "," with "." when using drive.py. When this happens it can make predicted steering values clipped to max/min values. If this occurs, a known fix for this is to add "export LANG=en_US.utf8" to the bashrc file.

#### Saving a video of the autonomous agent

```sh
python drive.py model.h5 run1
```

The fourth argument `run1` is the directory to save the images seen by the agent to. If the directory already exists it'll be overwritten.

```sh
ls run1

```

The image file name is a timestamp when the image image was seen. This information is used by `video.py` to create a chronological video of the agent driving.

### `video.py`

```sh
python video.py run1
```

Create a video based on images found in the `run1` directory. The name of the video will be name of the directory following by `'.mp4'`, so, in this case the video will be `run1.mp4`.

Optionally one can specify the FPS (frames per second) of the video:

```sh
python video.py run1 --fps 48
```

The video will run at 48 FPS. The default FPS is 60.

#### clone.py
This is the clone python file which is used to read the image and steer angle data to train model and save the model file with the format .h5.  I set the optimizer to 'sgd'  and epochs to 30. You can train your own model by modified the path to read the data in clone.py file.


#### model.h5
This is my trained model. This model can make the car run the whole lap of at the autonomous status. You can drive your car using this model or your own model.
